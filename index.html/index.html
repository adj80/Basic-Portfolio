			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I recently moved to Austin with my fur baby, a doberman pinscher, named Zoey. I am a bobcat from Texas State University- San Marcos (GO Bobcats!) as well as a roadrunner from UTSA so I guess you could call me a roadcat. I love Austin and all it has to offer. The landscape and friendly people are what attracted me to the city. I enjoy running, visiting with family and friends and spending time at the lake.
